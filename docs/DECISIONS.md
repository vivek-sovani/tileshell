# TileShell — Design Decisions

Decisions made when the spec/prototype was ambiguous, per CLAUDE.md workflow
rule 4. Newest first.

## S14 · Merge to folder

- **A merge reuses the target tile's id as the folder id.** The prototype splices
  a brand-new `g-<timestamp>` group into the target's slot. Our schema convention
  (DECISIONS S5) is that a folder tile and its `folders` row share one id, so
  `computeMerge` instead makes the *target tile's own id* the folder id — for an
  app→folder promotion the app tile is rewritten in place as a folder tile, and
  for an existing folder the id is already its folder id. So `MergeResult.folderId`
  is always `target.id`, and no id generator is needed.

- **De-duplication is by component (`packageName/activityName`), not package.**
  The prototype dedups by app id (its ids are packages). Real apps are identified
  by their launcher component, so two activities of the same package stay
  distinct. Union order is target's apps first, then the dragged tile's, matching
  the prototype.

- **The merge persists the surviving reorder, in one transaction.** Dragging onto
  a centre zone first crosses other tiles' edge zones, incurring incidental
  reorders in the working order. To keep the persisted layout matching what the
  user sees (and to mirror the prototype, which mutates one shared array for both
  reorder and merge), `applyMerge` renumbers the surviving tiles to the working
  order *after* writing the folder and dropping the dragged tile — all inside the
  same `@Transaction`. The folder tile reuses the target's id, so it is part of
  that renumber.

- **The 4-icon folder face already existed (S6); only targeting/highlight is new.**
  `FolderTileContent` has rendered a 2×2 mini-grid of the first four child glyphs
  since S6, so S14 added no new face. The merge-target highlight is the prototype
  `.merge-target` 3 px inset outline (`Modifier.border`), and the target is held
  at full opacity (exempt from the .45 edit-mode dim) so it reads as the drop
  destination. The "grouped" toast fires optimistically on drop, like the
  prototype's synchronous `toast('grouped')`.

## S13 · Drag to reorder

- **The dragged tile follows the finger; the prototype only reflows.** The
  prototype's edit drag just splices the array and lets CSS reflow — the tile
  never tracks the cursor and has no scale. FR-3.2 (the session prompt) asks for
  "lift with scale/shadow, follow finger", which is the real WP behaviour, so
  S13 goes beyond the prototype: the lifted tile detaches to a finger-anchored
  offset (1.08 scale + shadow, raised z) while the rest re-flow live.

- **`DenseTileGrid` was inverted from a custom `Layout` to a sized `Box` of
  self-offsetting children.** To finger-follow one tile while animating the
  others, each tile needs its own positionable offset. The grid now computes
  every tile's slot via the shared [GridGeometry] and hands `(slot, sizePx)` to
  the caller, which applies `Modifier.offset { … }` — an `animateIntOffsetAsState`
  slot for resting tiles, the live drag offset for the dragged one. `key(p.id)`
  wraps each tile so per-tile animation state survives a re-flow. Visual spacing
  is unchanged (identical unit/gap/side/top math, now in `GridGeometry`).

- **Hit-testing is synchronous geometry, not `onGloballyPositioned`.** The drag
  gesture is attached to the whole grid, so pointer positions are already
  grid-local; it re-packs the current working order with `GridPacker` and tests
  the finger against `GridGeometry` rects each move. Deterministic and lag-free
  during fast drags (no async layout callbacks), and the same geometry the grid
  renders with, so they can't disagree.

- **Reorder only in the edge zone; centre is reserved.** Hovering the inner
  22–78% of a tile (`inMergeZone`) suppresses reorder, leaving that gesture for
  the S14 folder merge. Outside it, the tile takes over the target's slot, with a
  `lastTarget` guard so crossing one tile reorders once (prototype behaviour).

- **Working order is a separate `SnapshotStateList`, reconciled not reset.** The
  grid renders a local `order` that the drag mutates live; the drop persists it
  via `LayoutDao.applyOrder` (one transaction renumbering `position`). The
  re-sync from the persisted flow *preserves* the existing relative order of
  surviving ids (appending pins, dropping uninstalls) rather than overwriting —
  so the async DB write after a drop lands the same order with no snap-back
  flicker.

- **Auto-scroll is a state-driven frame loop.** The gesture sets a −1/0/+1
  direction from the finger's viewport-Y (mapping content→viewport via the
  status-bar inset + `scrollState.value`); a `LaunchedEffect` scrolls one step
  per frame until it leaves the edge zone or `scrollBy` reports the edge. While
  the finger is stationary at an edge, reorder catches up on the next move
  (acceptable per the SESSION-PLAN's auto-scroll fallback note).

## S12 · Edit mode entry/exit + chrome

- **Tile corner controls and add/personalize are visual chrome only this
  session.** The prototype renders unpin (close, top-left) and resize (bottom-
  right) on the selected tile, and add/personalize/done in the bottom edit bar.
  Their *actions* (unpin removes a tile, resize cycles size, add → app list,
  personalize → sheet) are explicitly SESSION-PLAN S15 work and need repository
  mutators that don't exist yet. S12 therefore renders all of them but wires
  only `done` → `exitEdit` (an FR-3.1 exit path). The non-wired buttons carry no
  `clickable` (rendered, inert) rather than a no-op stub, so there are no dead
  handlers to remove in S15.

- **Edit mode state lives in `StartViewModel`, not local Compose state.** Home
  (`onNewIntent`/`goHome`) and Back (`MainActivity` back callback) both need to
  read and clear it, and entering edit must flip the existing `swipeEnabled`
  flag that gates the pager. Keeping `editMode`/`selectedTileId` as `StateFlow`
  on the VM lets all three call sites share one source of truth; `enterEdit`/
  `exitEdit` also own the swipe toggle.

- **Selection is fixed at entry (prototype-faithful).** The prototype only sets
  the selected tile via the long-press that enters edit; once editing, a plain
  tap on any tile (or empty space) exits rather than re-selecting. S12 mirrors
  this — re-selection/drag is S13. The long-press timer is only armed out of
  edit mode.

- **Jiggle uses one shared phase, composed only while editing.** Rather than a
  per-tile infinite animation, a single `rememberInfiniteTransition` drives a
  ±.5° phase that even/odd tiles apply with opposite sign (approximating the CSS
  `nth-child(2n)` −.45s delay). It is gated behind `if (!editMode) return 0f`,
  so a resting Start screen runs no animation frames. The press-tilt effect
  (S7) is suppressed while editing. This is the "live-animation pause hook":
  real live tiles aren't wired into Start yet, so pausing them is a genuine
  no-op for now.

## S11 · Pin from app list

- **A pinned app's "default colour" is derived deterministically from its
  package.** The prototype pins in each app's authored `col` (data.js), falling
  back to blue. Real Android apps declare no WP tile colour, so rather than pin
  everything blue, `TileColors.defaultIdFor` folds the package name into one of
  the 14 palette ids — the same app always pins to the same colour, giving a
  varied board while staying stable across sessions.
- **"Already on start" is checked against top-level app tiles only.** Matching
  the prototype's `tiles.some(t=>t.app===appId)`, the de-dupe (`appTileCount`)
  looks at pinned/seeded app tiles by package, not folder children — an app that
  only lives inside a folder can still be pinned as its own tile. New tiles
  append at `MAX(position)+1`; the dense packer places them.

## S10 · Search + jump grid

- **The `#` jump cell is a real, tappable section.** The prototype's `buildJump`
  forces the `#` cell `off` (`c!=='#' && have.has(c)`) because its demo apps get
  a digit header (e.g. "9 → 9"), never `#`. TileShell instead buckets every
  non-letter app under a single `#` section (`AppEntry.letter`), so `#` is a
  genuine jump target — its cell lights up as accent and scrolls there whenever
  such apps exist, matching how our headers actually group. Letters absent from
  the (filtered) list stay dimmed and dismiss the grid on tap, as in the
  prototype.
- **Jump grid reflects the filtered list.** `availableLetters`/scroll targets are
  computed from the currently displayed (post-search) apps rather than the full
  catalogue, so a jump always lands on a visible header even while filtering.

## S9 · Alphabetical app list

- **App-list rows show the real app icon, not a monoline glyph.** The
  prototype renders each app-list row as an accent square with the app's
  monoline `ic` glyph, but that only works for its curated demo set — arbitrary
  installed apps have no TileShell glyph. Rows therefore show the real launcher
  icon (loaded via `PackageManager.getActivityIcon` off the main thread,
  `produceState`) on top of the accent square, which is kept as the backing so
  transparent icons still read as a tile. The generic "app" glyph is the
  fallback when an icon fails to load. Start-screen tiles are unaffected (they
  keep monoline glyphs).

## S5 · Room schema + seeder

- **`TileSize` canonical home is `:core:data`.** S3 defined `TileSize` in
  `:feature:start` and S4 duplicated a preview-only copy in `:core:design`.
  Persisted layout models need it, so the canonical enum now lives in
  `:core:data` (`com.tileshell.core.data.TileSize`); `:feature:start` depends on
  `:core:data` and imports it. The `:core:design` preview enum stays private
  (preview-only; keeps the design module free of a data-layer dependency).

- **Schema shape (spec §4.3, not re-read — WP-faithful reconstruction).**
  Four entities: `tiles` (ordered grid items, `type` = app|folder, app columns
  nullable, `folderId` links folder tiles to their meta), `folders` (id + name),
  `folder_children` (folderId FK + position + component, `onDelete=CASCADE`),
  `app_cache` (component → label/letter/lastSeen for offline tile rendering and
  uninstall detection). A folder tile and its `folders` row share the same id
  (e.g. `g-social`); `tiles.folderId == tiles.id` for folder tiles. No FK on
  `tiles.folderId` (avoids insert-ordering constraints; Room `@Relation` does
  not require one).

- **Seeder role mapping.** Prototype app ids are generic roles. Each maps to a
  standard intent/category resolved against installed apps; the resolved
  package's *launcher* activity is stored so tapping a tile opens the app's
  entry point. Roles with no Android equivalent (weather, notes, bank, auth,
  …) have no mapping and their tiles are skipped. Folders keep only resolvable,
  de-duplicated children and are dropped entirely if none resolve. Positions
  are re-numbered contiguously after skips so dense packing is unaffected.

- **Migration scaffolding.** Database is version 1 with `exportSchema=true`
  (schema JSON under `core/data/schemas/`). `TileShellDatabase.MIGRATIONS` is an
  empty array wired into the builder, ready for future versioned migrations.
