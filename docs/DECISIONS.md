# TileShell — Design Decisions

Decisions made when the spec/prototype was ambiguous, per CLAUDE.md workflow
rule 4. Newest first.

## S9 · Alphabetical app list

- **App-list rows show the real app icon, not a monoline glyph.** The
  prototype renders each app-list row as an accent square with the app's
  monoline `ic` glyph, but that only works for its curated demo set — arbitrary
  installed apps have no TileShell glyph. Rows therefore show the real launcher
  icon (loaded via `PackageManager.getActivityIcon` off the main thread,
  `produceState`) on top of the accent square, which is kept as the backing so
  transparent icons still read as a tile. The generic "app" glyph is the
  fallback when an icon fails to load. Start-screen tiles are unaffected (they
  keep monoline glyphs).

## S5 · Room schema + seeder

- **`TileSize` canonical home is `:core:data`.** S3 defined `TileSize` in
  `:feature:start` and S4 duplicated a preview-only copy in `:core:design`.
  Persisted layout models need it, so the canonical enum now lives in
  `:core:data` (`com.tileshell.core.data.TileSize`); `:feature:start` depends on
  `:core:data` and imports it. The `:core:design` preview enum stays private
  (preview-only; keeps the design module free of a data-layer dependency).

- **Schema shape (spec §4.3, not re-read — WP-faithful reconstruction).**
  Four entities: `tiles` (ordered grid items, `type` = app|folder, app columns
  nullable, `folderId` links folder tiles to their meta), `folders` (id + name),
  `folder_children` (folderId FK + position + component, `onDelete=CASCADE`),
  `app_cache` (component → label/letter/lastSeen for offline tile rendering and
  uninstall detection). A folder tile and its `folders` row share the same id
  (e.g. `g-social`); `tiles.folderId == tiles.id` for folder tiles. No FK on
  `tiles.folderId` (avoids insert-ordering constraints; Room `@Relation` does
  not require one).

- **Seeder role mapping.** Prototype app ids are generic roles. Each maps to a
  standard intent/category resolved against installed apps; the resolved
  package's *launcher* activity is stored so tapping a tile opens the app's
  entry point. Roles with no Android equivalent (weather, notes, bank, auth,
  …) have no mapping and their tiles are skipped. Folders keep only resolvable,
  de-duplicated children and are dropped entirely if none resolve. Positions
  are re-numbered contiguously after skips so dense packing is unaffected.

- **Migration scaffolding.** Database is version 1 with `exportSchema=true`
  (schema JSON under `core/data/schemas/`). `TileShellDatabase.MIGRATIONS` is an
  empty array wired into the builder, ready for future versioned migrations.
